## General Tips
- **Hardware**: Use Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense for built-in sensors and ML support (TensorFlow Lite Micro). Arduino Edge Control is ideal for agriculture projects.[](https://docs.edgeimpulse.com/docs/integrations/arduino-mltools)
- **ML Framework**: Use TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers or EloquentTinyML for lightweight ML models. Train models on a PC using Python (e.g., scikit-learn, TensorFlow) and convert to C++ for Arduino.[](https://eloquentarduino.github.io/category/programming/arduino-machine-learning/arduino-machine-learning-project/)[](https://eloquentarduino.com/posts/arduino-machine-learning)
- **Power**: Use Li-ion batteries with TP4056 chargers for mobile projects; ensure 5V/3.3V compatibility.
- **Data Collection**: Collect sensor data via Serial or SD card; preprocess on a PC for ML training.[](https://github.com/NikodemBartnik/Machine-Learning-Robot)
- **Memory**: Optimize models for SRAM (2KB on Nano 33 BLE Sense) and Flash (256KB). Use PROGMEM for constants.[](https://medium.com/%40techworldthink/get-started-with-machine-learning-on-arduino-arduino-nano-33-ble-sense-9fa38dfb9563)
- **Safety**: Isolate high-power components (motors, relays) with drivers or transistors (e.g., TIP120).
