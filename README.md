## Course Overview
**Title:** Arduino Programming for Hands-On Projects  
**Description:** This project-based course introduces Arduino programming using C/C++ for embedded systems. It starts with fundamentals and progresses to advanced topics, emphasizing practical applications through real-world projects. Students will learn to interface hardware, write efficient code, and build interactive prototypes.  
**Objectives:**  
- Understand Arduino hardware and programming basics.

- Develop modular, efficient code for embedded projects.  
- Build and troubleshoot complete Arduino-based systems.  
- Gain confidence in prototyping IoT, robotics, and automation projects.  
**Prerequisites:** Basic programming knowledge (e.g., variables, loops) is helpful but not required. No prior electronics experience needed.  
**Duration:** 8-12 weeks (2-3 hours/week lectures + hands-on labs/projects).  
**Target Audience:** Beginners to intermediate learners, engineering students, hobbyists.
