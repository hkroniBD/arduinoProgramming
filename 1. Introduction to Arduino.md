#### **Part 3: Setting Up the Arduino Development Environment (45 minutes)**  
- **Explanation:**  
  - Steps to install Arduino IDE:  
    - Visit [Download Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).  
    - Choose the correct version (Windows, macOS, or Linux).  
    - Installation walkthrough.  
  - Connecting the Arduino board to a computer via USB.  
  - Configuring the IDE:  
    - Selecting the correct board and port from the *Tools* menu.  
- **Practical Activity:**  
  - Guide students through the IDE installation process.  
  - Verify the setup by connecting their Arduino board and checking if it's detected.

#### **Part 4: Basic Structure of an Arduino Program (30 minutes)**  
- **Explanation:**  
  - Introduction to the two main functions:  
    - **`setup()`**: Initializes configurations (runs once at start).  
    - **`loop()`**: Contains the core logic (runs repeatedly).  
  - Example Code:  

```cpp
void setup() {
  pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT); // Configures built-in LED pin as output
}

void loop() {
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH); // Turn LED on
  delay(1000);                     // Wait for 1 second
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, LOW);  // Turn LED off
  delay(1000);                     // Wait for 1 second
}
```

#### **Part 5: Writing the "Blink" Program (45 minutes)**  
- **Activity:**  
  - Explain how to use `pinMode()`, `digitalWrite()`, and `delay()`.  
  - Walk through uploading the program to the Arduino board:  
    - Verify code (check for errors).  
    - Upload code to the board.  
  - Observe the LED blinking on the Arduino board.  
- **Resources:**  
  - Arduino Reference: [https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/).  

---

#### **Part 6: Understanding the Arduino Pinout (30 minutes)**  
- **Explanation:**  
  - Digital pins (0–13): Input/output functionality.  
  - Analog pins (A0–A5): For reading analog signals.  
  - Power pins: 3.3V, 5V, GND.  
  - Special pins: Reset, PWM (~ symbol), TX/RX for communication.  
- **Activity:**  
  - Identify each pin on the Arduino Uno and understand its usage.

### **Assignment**  
1. Install the Arduino IDE on your personal computer.  
2. Write a program that makes the built-in LED blink twice quickly, then stay off for 2 seconds, and repeat.  
3. Submit your program code and a short video of it running on your Arduino board.  

**Example Code for Reference:**  

```cpp
void setup() {
  pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  // Blink twice quickly
  for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
    digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH);
    delay(200); // LED on for 200ms
    digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, LOW);
    delay(200); // LED off for 200ms
  }
  // Wait for 2 seconds
  delay(2000);
}
```
